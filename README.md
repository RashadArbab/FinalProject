# Final Project (6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon)
This was the final project for MSCI240 Data Structures and Algorithms. Where I was tasked with mining a large graph dataset for key pieces of information such as the average size of cluster, the distance between my indavidual key node and Kevin Bacon, and the average degrees of seperation between any two nodes in the graph.
